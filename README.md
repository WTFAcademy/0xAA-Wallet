# 0xAA-Wallet
0xAA Wallet is a AA (Account Abstraction) wallet focused on developer education and experience, which helps developers build ERC4337 compatible Dapp. 

## Objectives
We will built a MVP of 0xAA Wallet and tutorial on how to develop ERC4337 compatible Dapp with this grant. 0xAA Wallet is a web wallet that help developer to build and test ERC4337 compatible contract.

## Outcomes
Developers will have a better tooling to develop ERC4337 compatible contract and Dapp.

## Grant Scope
We will research on ERC-4337 in detail, and build a wallet for developers.

## Background

WTF Academy is a web3 open-source university for developers, we aim to onboard 10,000 developers to Ethereum. We have built:

1. WTF Soldiity (https://github.com/AmazingAng/WTF-Solidity): 70+ chapters, 6,700+ stars, 90+ contributors, top 3 Solidity repo in Github.
2. WTF Ethers (https://github.com/WTFAcademy/WTF-Ethers): 20+ chapters, 1,500+ stars, 20+ contributors, top 3 Ethers repo in Github.
3. Education Platform (https://wtf.academy): integrated education platform including tutorials, quizzes, and onchain certificates, for free.
4. Solive (https://ethglobal.com/showcase/solive-picjb): Solive is a flexible online playground for Solidity smart contracts, inspired by remix-IDE and react-live. You can edit, compile, deploy, and interact with solidity smart contracts in one React component. This will be essential component for 0xAA wallet.
